# Pytorch-DNN-Classification-Regression


This lab focuses on using PyTorch for both Classification and Regression tasks, emphasizing the implementation of robust models using Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures.

## Regression

Explore and visualize the NYSE stock prices dataset, construct a PyTorch-based DNN architecture for regression tasks, and perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch for optimal model efficiency. Visualizations illustrate Loss vs. Epochs and Accuracy vs. Epochs, and regularization techniques are implemented and compared.

## Multi-Class Classification

Preprocess data, conduct exploratory data analysis, apply data augmentation techniques, and build a PyTorch-based DNN architecture for multi-class classification. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch, visualization of key metrics, and the application of regularization techniques are included.

The lab provides a hands-on experience in leveraging PyTorch, highlighting the significance of data analysis, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation techniques.
